These benchmarks are from:

https://github.com/tancheng/CGRA-Bench

And also from the LivermoreC Loops

Some of the benchmarks are omitted because they are too big for OpenCGRA to map to heterogeneous CGRAs.  These are:

	- adpcm_coder/
	- adpcm_decoder/

For benchmarks with multiple key loops, we benchmark each loop independently.  Folders are named <Name>N
