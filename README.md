Jackson's Additional Steps:

Building:

 - Get nix (https://nixos.org/)
 - nix-shell # fetches dependencies
 - mkdir build && cd build
 - cmake ..
 - make

Running example:
 - cd test
 - vim kernel.cpp # edit the loop to contain whatever.
 - `./compile.sh`, generate LLVM bitcode for that loop.
 - ./run.sh --build # builds a cgra for that loop.
 - ./build_param.sh operations.json # build the settings file for this new loop.
 - ./run.sh # bulid for the CGRA that you just defined --- this should work
 - vim kernel.cpp # edit this again to change it
 - ./run.sh # without build, tries to compile the loop to that particular cgra configuration.
 - ./run.sh --use-egraphs # use the egraphs rewriter
 - ./run.sh --rewriter # use the traditioanl rewriter.
 - Apply some rewrite rules by hand and try and make it work :)

#Running tests against a single cgra
 - git clone git@github.com:j-c-w/LoopBenchmarks
 - /run_tests_against.sh <file name>  <benchmarks location> --use-egraphs
 - /run_tests_against.sh <file name>  <benchmarks location>

 - <file name> should be a C file within Loop Benchmarks (e.g. ../../LoopBenchmarks/ll_loops/loops/loop10.c )
 - <benchmarks location> should be the parent directory of the LoopBenchmarks repo
 - Outputs are left in run_output.old

(Cloned from https://github.com/tancheng/CGRA-Mapper)

This is a CGRA (Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture) mapper to map the target loops onto the CGRA. The CGRA is parameterizable (e.g., CGRA size, type of the computing units in each tile, communication connection, etc.). Different advanced mapping strategies are built on top of this basic mapper. CGRA Mapper currently provides following features and functionalities:
- It takes the arch&kernel info in `JSON` format. 
- It can generate the DFG/CDFG of the target code region (in `.png`).
- Nested-loop and complex if/else control flows are supported with [partial predication](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2593069.2593100).
- Users can easily invoke loop-unrolling in the compile/run script (`opt --loop-unroll --unroll-count=4 -load PATH/libmapperPass.so -mapperPass kernel.bc`).
- It schedules and maps the DFG onto the CGRA arch that is represented in [MRRG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188678).
- The generated dfg.json and config.json can be taken as inputs for the simulation in the [OpenCGRA](https://github.com/tancheng/OpenCGRA) (register index needed to be manually added/distinguished).
- Benchmark including a set of representative kernels/applications with compilation scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/tancheng/CGRA-Bench).

Build
--------------------------------------------------------

The mapper requires the following additional prerequisites:

 - LLVM 4.0 ~ LLVM 12.0
 - CMAKE 3.1


Execution
--------------------------------------------------------
- The pass should be built and run with the same version of the LLVM.

- A [param.json](https://github.com/tancheng/CGRA-Bench/blob/master/kernels/fir/param.json) indicating the configuration of the target CGRA and the kernel should locate in the kernel folder.
  - The [kernel](https://github.com/tancheng/CGRA-Bench/blob/d9182292651bf9b5f16e9f16eee908937e57ff4d/kernels/fir/param.json#L2) name in the `param.json` should be identical as the [function name](https://github.com/tancheng/CGRA-Bench/blob/8f3f20167883680735d1d79cd6f2c1439c999950/kernels/fir/fir.ll#L33) shown in the generated IR file. Note that different versions of LLVM could lead to different generated function names, which should be explicitly indicated in the `param.json` by the users.
- Run:
```
 % opt -load ~/this repo/build/mapper/libmapperPass.so -mapperPass ~/target benchmark/target_kernel.bc
```
